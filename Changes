Revision history for App-ZofCMS

0.0223  Oct 22, 2013
	1) Fixed inconsistent versions (for CPANTS Game)
	2) Made zofcms_helper NOT overwrite existing plugin files, when --plugins option is used.
	   The new option --overwrite_existing_plugins=1 can be used to elicit plugin overwrite
	3) Added use strict/warnings and plugins => [] to the default file made by --pages option in
	   the zofcms_helper.
	4) Removed use_ok('Carp') test as it was throwing warnings. Carp is core anyway, so the test is
	   somewhat useless.
